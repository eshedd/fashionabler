# Fashionabler ðŸ‘–
A smart clothing recommender for my fashion-incompetent self built with [FashionCLIP](https://github.com/patrickjohncyh/fashion-clip).

## Installation
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
### M1 Mac
- `pip install 'rembg[cpu]'` for using CPU
- Downgrade to `transformations==4.42.4` (see [issue](https://github.com/patrickjohncyh/fashion-clip/issues/39#issuecomment-2506391126))

## Notes
- FashionCLIP has a limit of 77 tokens, so keep the prompt to less than that

### TODO
- [ ] Use weather report and emotion prediction for informing outfit
- [ ] Add laundry (i.e. remove worn clothes from recommendation)
- [ ] Generative try-on (VTON) feature
- [ ] Track clothing article usage frequency
